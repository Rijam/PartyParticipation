Party Participation makes it so the Zoologist, Old Man, Tax Collector, Skeleton Merchant, and Shimmered Dryad all wear party hats during parties.
It also has an option to replace the dialog line from the Zoologist where she says she can't wear party hats.

The mod is completely configurable; You can choose which of these Town NPCs you wish to wear party hats.

The mod is also client sided. You can use this in multiplayer without affecting other players.
